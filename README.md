# Gear Alert

-   You can check and update your maintenance data via the [web app](https://vercel.com/yourtempo/gearalert).
-   Whenever you finish a ride with a bike that requires maintenance, you will receive an email informing which bike, which part and the distance since the maintenance is due for it.
